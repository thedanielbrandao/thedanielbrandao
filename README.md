Hey guys!
I speak Portuguese (natively) and English, and currently I'm learning German and French. As you can see, I like studying languages.
Now, I'm trying to learn programming languages, as I love technologies. Not sure yet if I prefer front-end or back-end.
I also like Soccer and Basketball, so I'm a sports fan, although I'm not exactly the most athletic guy you'll meet haha.
Another thing I really love is traveling. I know it's a cliche, but someday I'm gonna visit lots of countries and places around the world.
And I am still working on this README.md.

You can contact me by email: dan.bpassos@gmail.com or Instagram @thedanielbrandao.
